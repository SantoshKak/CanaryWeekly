## Introduction
This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing of web applications. Playwright provides a fast and reliable framework for testing modern web applications across different browsers.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-playwright-project.git
   cd your-playwright-project
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the browsers required by Playwright:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Usage
To run Playwright tests, use the following commands:

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Run a specific test file:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js
  ```

- Run tests with a specific browser:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --project=chromium
  npx playwright test --project=firefox
  npx playwright test --project=webkit
  ```

## Configuration
You can configure Playwright settings in the `playwright.config.js` file. This file allows you to set options like test directory, timeout, retries, and more. Here's an example configuration:

```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: {
    headless: false,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
    actionTimeout: 10000,
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { browserName: 'chromium' },
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { browserName: 'firefox' },
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { browserName: 'webkit' },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following commands:

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Run tests in a specific file:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js
  ```
